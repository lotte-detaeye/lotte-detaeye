## About Me
Hello :), I'm a former scholar in Literature and Linguistics who got excited about programming. My core interests are in understanding fundamental low-level structures and using that knowledge to write transparent and reliable code. I'm particularly curious about the possibilities of Gen AI and LLMs, and how they could support high quality writing, language learning, and knowledge access.
My full name is Lieselot De Taeye; in Germany I go by Lotte.

## Top Projects
- My_IRC (https://github.com/lotte-detaeye/ft_irc): an IRC server in C++ that is fully compatible with an official client
- Toxicity (https://github.com/lotte-detaeye/toxicity): LLM-integrated app focused on detecting toxic speech
- Contained (https://github.com/lotte-detaeye/contained): 3 tier website project (poetry blog) where every service runs in a separate Docker container

## Older Projects
- Cub3D (https://github.com/lotte-detaeye/cub3d): This project (made with @MacMosby) is a simplified recreation of the game Wolfenstein 3D, featuring a raycasting algorithm to render the maze. 
- Fractals (https://github.com/lotte-detaeye/fractals): This program displays two different kinds of fractals on the screen. It uses a mathematical algorithm to define each pixel
- Minishell (https://github.com/lotte-detaeye/minishell): This collaborative project (with @n-andr) implements the core command-line functionalities of a basic Linux terminal
