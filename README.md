## About Me
Hello :), I'm a former literary scholar who got excited about programming. My core interests are in understanding fundamental low-level structures and using that knowledge to write transparent and reliable code.

## Top Projects
- Cub3D (https://github.com/lotte-detaeye/cub3d): This project (made with @MacMosby) is a simplified recreation of the game Wolfenstein 3D, featuring a raycasting algorithm to render the maze. 
- Minishell (https://github.com/lotte-detaeye/minishell): This collaborative project (with @n-andr) delivers a robust command-line environment that emulates core Bash functionality. The shell we built is similar to a simplified Linux terminal.
- Fractals (https://github.com/lotte-detaeye/fractals): This program displays two different kinds of fractals on the screen.
